      This project focuses on developing a pirate intelligent agent for a treasure hunt video game using deep Q-learning. The goal of the agent is to navigate an 8x8 maze, avoiding obstacles and making strategic decisions to find the treasure before the human player. To achieve this, I implemented reinforcement learning techniques and designed a deep Q-learning algorithm to optimize the pirate's pathfinding abilities.
     For this project, I was provided with starter code that included a predefined game environment, an 8x8 grid world, and pre-set game mechanics such as obstacles and states. Additionally, the base structure for reinforcement learning was given, but I needed to complete the Q-training algorithm to enable the pirate agent to learn effectively. My contributions included implementing the Q-learning model, designing the neural network architecture using TensorFlow and Keras, and configuring the hyperparameters such as the learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate. I also applied reward structures to help the agent learn optimal navigation strategies and ensured that the program ran without errors. Through multiple training iterations, I was able to optimize the agentâ€™s ability to locate the treasure efficiently.
     This project highlights key concepts in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and problem-solving, all of which are fundamental to computer science. Computer scientists play a crucial role in developing algorithms and intelligent systems that impact a variety of industries, from gaming to healthcare and automation. My approach to solving this problem mirrored the structured methodology used in computer science: I started by understanding the problem, analyzing the given code, implementing the missing components, and iteratively testing and refining the model. By leveraging reinforcement learning techniques, I was able to create an intelligent agent capable of making data-driven decisions in an interactive environment.
     Beyond technical implementation, ethical responsibilities are an important consideration in AI development. It is essential to ensure that AI models are fair, unbiased, and transparent, especially in real-world applications where decision-making impacts users. Additionally, writing clean, well-documented, and maintainable code is crucial for long-term usability and collaboration. As an AI developer, I also recognize the importance of data privacy and responsible AI development in ensuring ethical outcomes for both users and organizations.
     This project has strengthened my understanding of reinforcement learning, neural networks, and AI-driven decision-making. By completing this work, I have demonstrated my ability to apply deep learning concepts in practical problem-solving scenarios. My completed Jupyter Notebook includes the implementation of the pirate intelligent agent and my project reflections.
